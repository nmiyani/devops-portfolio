  aboutMe:
    "I’m a DevOps and Cloud Engineer currently pursuing my B.E. in Information Technology. I focus on building reliable cloud infrastructure and automating deployment workflows to make systems scalable, consistent, and easier to manage. I have hands-on experience with Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins, Prometheus, and Grafana. I enjoy working with containerized environments, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code to deliver repeatable and stable environments. Learning-by-doing motivates me the most — understanding how systems work internally and improving them step-by-step. I’m open to opportunities where I can contribute, collaborate, and continue growing in DevOps and Cloud Engineering.",
